# Pre-requisite Knowledge

Before you go on, here's some topics and Python package APIs that are handy for you to know.

My notes:

- Python: requisite.
- NumPy API: requisite.
- SciPy API: requisite.
- How to take derivatives: good to know, I'll cover a bit of it.
- How to write functional style programs: good to know, but I'll cover it.
- Deep learning: not necessary; one chapter covers how to write neural networks using nothing but NumPy, and how to train them using JAX's `grad`, and another chapter covers a way of writing neural netowrks using `stax`.
- Statistical modelling: needed only for the chapters using likelihoods and finding maximum likelihood param values using gradient descent.
