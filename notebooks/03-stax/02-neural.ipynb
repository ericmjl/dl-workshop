    "In this notebook, we saw a few things in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we saw how to use the `stax` module on a linear model. Anytime we have a new framework for doing differential programming, it's super important to be able to explore it in the context of a linear model, which is _basically_ the foundation of all deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we also explored how to leverage the JAX idioms to create fast parallelized training loops. We mixed-and-matched together `jit`, `vmap`, `lax.scan`, and `grad` into a performant training loop that was minimally nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corollary of this programming style is that _every piece of the code can, in principle, be properly tested_, because they are properly isolated. Have you written training loops where you modify a little piece here and a little piece there, until you lost what your original working one looked like? With training functions that are minimally nested, we can control the behaviour explicitly using closures/partials easily. Even when doing experimenation, our code can run reliably and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we saw how to apply the same lessons to training a neural network _really fast_ with multiple starting points. The essence of the solution was to properly structure our program in progressively higher level layers of abstraction. We carefully wrote the program to go from the inner most layer out until we hit our goal of allowing for a set of multiple starts. The key here is that each level of abstraction is very natural, and corresponds to a \"unit computation\" being applied consistently across an \"array\" of things. Once we identify that \"unit computation\", writing the `vmap`-able or `lax.scan`-able function becomes very easy."
