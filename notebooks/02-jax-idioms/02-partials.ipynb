This is going to be important, as it'll allow us to construct functions that are compatible with the requirements of `vmap` and `lax.scan` and others in JAX, i.e. they have the correct function signature, but still allow us the flexibility to put in arbitrary things that might be needed for the function to work correctly.\n",
